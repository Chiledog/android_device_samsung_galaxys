# This file is the build configuration for a full Android
# build for crespo hardware. This cleanly combines a set of
# device-specific aspects (drivers) with a device-agnostic
# product configuration (apps).
#

# NFC is a product-level aspect that is too closely tied
# to this device to justify putting in a more generic config,
# but which is also not quite a low-level driver to put in
# device.mk
